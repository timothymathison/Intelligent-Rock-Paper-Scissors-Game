# Intelligent-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Python and Predictive Logic (My first Software Project)

This was my first major software project, which I worked on entirely alone when I was in high school. After writing a simple rock paper scissors game, it occured to me that it would be interesting and fun to make the computer try to out guess the person playing the game.

The game is played inside the terminal, with a simple loop back menu system. However, behind the scenes the computer keeps track of every decision the player makes, and utilizes that information to "guess" what the player will choose next.
